            This is the tiramisu that will transport you straight to a cafe in 
            Italy! It’s rich and decadent and has all the flavors of the classic 
            Italian dessert from the espresso-soaked lady fingers to velvety 
            mascarapone cream filling.  If you didn’t know, tiramisu means 
            “a pick me up” and that’s exactly what this sweet treat will do!

            The viral Kanafeh-inspired Chocolate Bar from a dessert spot called 
            The Fix in Dubai has been going viral and since lots of us are a 
            plane ride away, we're going to make it at home and even better! 
            Oozing with pistachio butter and crispy toasted shredded phyllo 
            bits, this chocolate is the definition of indulgence. Every single 
            bite is so creamy but also so crispy at the same time and the taste 
            is so reminiscent of everyone's favorite Arab dessert!
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4>INGREDIENTS</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup pistachio paste/butter</li>
            <li>1 to 1/2 cup shredded phyllo or kataifi, cut 
            into small pieces</li>
            <li>vegetable oil, for frying</li>
            <li>2 to 3 cups milk chocolate, melted</li>
            <li>1/4 cup white chocolate, melted</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>INSTRUCTIONS</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat vegetable oil in a frying pan to 350°F.</li>
            <li>Add the shredded phyllo in and fry until golden and crispy. If 
            frying another batch, use a slotted spoon to take 
            out the fried phyllo. Transfer to a plate with a paper towel 
            to drain excess oil.</li>
            <li>If you are not frying another batch, it'll be easier to set up a 
            bowl with a strainer and pour the pan over to let the oil drain and 
            the strainer catch the phyllo.</li>
            <li>Allow the fried phyllo to cool down for 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the pistachio paste to a mixing bowl along with the fried 
            phyllo and mix together to combine.</li>
            <li>OPTIONAL: To the chocolate mold, add a light drizzle 
            of white chocolate.</li>
            <li>Then add in about 1/4 cup or more of melted milk chocolate and 
            shake it around to cover the bottom and sides completely.</li>
            <li>Pop in the fridge or freezer for 10 to 15 
            minutes until hard.</li>
            <li>Take the mold out and fill the chocolate mold with the pistachio 
            and phyllo mixture almost all the way to the top.</li>
            <li>Cover the filling entirely with more melted chocolate and pop it 
            back in the fridge or freezer for 10 to 15 minutes until hard.</li>
            <li>Once set, pop out of the mold and enjoy!</li>
