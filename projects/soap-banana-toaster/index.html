            <h1>History of Digital Art</h1>
            <p>
                When was Digital Art Invented?
            </p>
            <p>
                The earliest forms of digital art can be traced back to the 
                1960s, when artists began experimenting with computers as a 
                medium for creating visual art. One of the first artists to 
                work with digital technology was John Whitney, who used a 
                computer to create abstract animations in the 1960s.

            <h3>Clip Studio Paint</h3>
            <p>
                    when was Clip Studio Paint made?
            </p>
            <p>
                CLIP STUDIO PAINT was released in 2012. CLIP STUDIO PAINT is 
                an all-purpose drawing tool where users can draw both comics 
                and illustrations.
            </p>
            <p>
                Why does this matter?
            </p>
            <p>
                It matters to me because me and other digital artists/ 
                graphic/web designers have been doing this for years. As well 
                as the fact that most of us use digital software like 
                Clip Studio Paint for our works/projects.To this very day 
                I make and post artwork on my social media.

            <h3>What, or who is Soap Banana Toaster?</h3>
            <p>
                Hi. I’m Soap Banana Toaster. But you can just call me Soap.
                I specialize in everything digital art and creative design 
                related. (mostly illustrations, character design, and 
                creative writing.) as well as animation, music production, 
                and graphic/website design.
            </p>
            <p>
                I go by the screen name Soap Banana Toaster (SBT). 
                If you need to find me online anywhere, I go by this alias.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can also find me by looking for my mascot. You can’t 
                miss it. It is a blue bird with a bubble mohawk.

            </p>
            <p>
                I came up with the name: Soap Banana Toaster, a few years ago 
                when I was brainstorming a popular username for online brand 
                recognition. Something that would be memorable and a household 
                name that everyone would recognize and remember.
            </p>
            <p>
                And so, “Soap Banana Toaster” was born.
