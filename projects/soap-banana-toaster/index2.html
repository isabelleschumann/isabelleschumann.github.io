            <p>
                Hello there! Iâ€™m Isabelle Schumann, Also known on social media 
                as: Soap Banana Toaster. (Soap.)
            </p>
            <h3>My background and where I come from:</h3>
            <p>
                I was Born in the state of Michigan. At 8 years old I moved to 
                the state of Florida in 2008.My parents were divorced and my 
                family was broken. I survived a broken household.My start 
                in life was NEVER easy. And there were times as a kid I 
                wished it was.Bullies, and my own father would say that 
                I would "never make it in this world as an artist."
            </p>
            <p>
                But I'm here today to prove them wrong, and to stand up for 
                fellow artists, to make a difference in this world. I am here 
                to INSPIRE artists like you, to KEEP GOING, and to make a 
                living and lifestyle out of creating what you love. Art.
            </p>
            <p>
                I kept going because I believed in myself, and SO CAN YOU!
