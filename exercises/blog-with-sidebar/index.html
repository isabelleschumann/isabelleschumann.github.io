                    When alien Irken infiltrator Zim suddenly reappears after a 
                    long absence, his now-overweight human nemesis Dib Membrane 
                    confronts him. Zim reveals that his disappearance was meant 
                    to make Dib too physically unfit to oppose him, allowing 
                    Zim to begin Phase Two of his plan. Zim contacts his 
                    leaders, the Almighty Tallest, but realizes that he has 
                    forgotten what Phase Two entails.

                    Dib regains his physical fitness with help from his sister 
                    Gaz. Their father, Professor Membrane, gives Dib a 
                    prototype device called the Membracelet, meant to harness 
                    the positive energy of the world's children, but expresses 
                    his disappointment in Dib's continued belief in aliens. An 
                    incensed Dib goes to confront Zim, but finds him in a state 
                    of depression; Zim and his robotic assistant GIR have been 
                    unable to remember Phase Two and, furthermore, have realized 
                    that the Irken Armada does not plan to invade Earth. 
                    Defeated, Zim surrenders to Dib, who decides to present him 
                    to the world during his father's Membracelet presentation.

                    At Professor Membrane's keynote address, Dib allows Zim to 
                    modify the Membracelet to hijack the presentation. However, 
                    as soon as Zim is free, the lights go out, Membrane 
                    disappears, and Zim takes control of the stage in disguise. 
                    Dib awakens the next day to find that he and Gaz are 
                    imprisoned in their own home by Clembrane, a failed clone of 
                    their father, while Zim continues distributing Membracelets 
                    around the world. After GIR compels every child on Earth to 
                    hold hands while wearing the bracelets, Zim uses Minimoose 
                    and the combined energy of the Membracelets to teleport 
                    Earth into the Irken Armada's flight path and force the 
                    Tallest to visit him. However, the irritated Tallest decide 
                    to simply destroy him along with the Earth once they 
                    reach it.

                    The Earth's sudden teleportation opens a "Florpus", a 
                    space-time rift capable of consuming the planet and merging 
                    it with alternate realities, but Zim ignores the danger and 
                    begins preparing for the arrival of the Tallest. Dib and 
                    Gaz escape using a spaceship formerly belonging to Zim's 
                    Irken rival Tak and free Professor Membrane from 
                    intergalactic space prison Moo-Ping 10; Dib expresses his 
                    desire for his father to be proud of him, and Membrane 
                    tells Dib that he is already proud of him, despite his 
                    belief in the supernatural. Dib lands on Earth and fights 
                    Zim for control of Minimoose to stop the Florpus, while 
                    Membrane, revealed to have robotic prosthetics, helps Dib 
                    destroy Zim's robot army. Although the Membranes are able 
                    to recover Minimoose after turning Clembrane on Zim, the 
                    Irken Armada finally arrives to destroy Earth just as it 
                    enters the Florpus. As Earth begins colliding with 
                    alternate realities, Membrane finally figures out how to 
                    teleport the planet back to its original location, while the 
                    Armada flies directly into the Florpus.

                    Back on Earth, the Membrane family is reunited, and Zim 
                    appears at their window claiming the real goal of Phase Two 
                    was stealing a ceramic clown figurine from their living 
                    room. Zim contacts the Tallest to report his success, only 
                    to see them suffering in an alternate reality. Zim 
                    interprets their anguished screams as them being pleased 
                    with his work before he is crushed by a falling pug that GIR 
                    had launched into space at the film's beginning; GIR 
                    launches the pug into space again.
