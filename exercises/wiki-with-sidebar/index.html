                    <i><b>Pizza Tower</b></i> is a 2023 platform game created by the indie 
                    developer Tour De Pizza. It follows a pizza chef, Peppino 
                    Spaghetti, who must scale a tower to prevent the 
                    destruction of his pizzeria. Across 20 side-scrolling 
                    levels, the player increases their score by gathering 
                    collectibles and defeating enemies to build combos. At the 
                    end of each level, they activate an escape sequence and 
                    must return to the beginning within a time limit. Pizza 
                    Tower does not feature health or lives, and its difficulty 
                    depends on what the player chooses to achieve.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The development began around 2018 and was led by the 
                    pseudonymous designer McPig and programmer Sertif. Pizza 
                    Tower began as a role-playing video game with survival 
                    horror elements before evolving into a platformer inspired 
                    by Nintendo's dormant Wario Land series, to which McPig 
                    wanted to provide a spiritual successor. It was developed 
                    with GameMaker and features a cartoonish, high-resolution 
                    pixel art style inspired by SpongeBob SquarePants and 
                    French comics. Wario Land 4 (2001) served as the basis for 
                    the gameplay and level design.

                <p>
                    <i>Pizza Tower</i> developed a large fandom during its development 
                    through early access builds offered to Patreon backers and 
                    game demos. It was released for Windows on January 26, 2023. 
                    Pizza Tower received positive reviews and nominations for 
                    year-end accolades. Critics praised its gameplay, music, 
                    visuals, and humor. Critics favorably compared its art style 
                    to 1990s Nicktoons and the sense of speed to the Sonic the 
                    Hedgehog series. They considered it a worthy substitute for 
                    Wario Land, and some called it a rare spiritual successor 
                    that is better than its inspiration. Tour De Pizza 
                    has supported the game with updates adding new 
                    content into 2024.

                    <i>Pizza Tower</i> is a side-scrolling platform game. Its story 
                    begins when Peppino Spaghetti, an Italian pizza chef and 
                    the owner of a struggling pizzeria, is approached by 
                    Pizzaface, a sentient floating pizza.[1] Pizzaface 
                    threatens to destroy Peppino's pizzeria with a nuclear 
                    laser atop a nearby tower. Frightened and angered, 
                    Peppino sets out to ascend the tower and defeat 
                    Pizzaface to save his pizzeria.[2] The tower serves as the 
                    setting and hub world of the single-player game. It has 
                    five floors,[3] each containing four levels and a boss. 
                    Each level has a distinct theme and unique game mechanics,
                    [1] such as a cemetery with surfable corpses and a Five 
                    Nights at Freddy's homage with jump scares.[3][4]
                </p>
                <p>
                    Peppino, the primary player character, can walk, run, jump, 
                    roll, and slide. His attacks include a body slam, grabbing 
                    and throwing enemies, and a parry.[3][5] If Peppino runs 
                    for long enough, he begins to dash, allowing him to run up 
                    walls and plow through enemies and objects.[5] Defeating an 
                    enemy initiates a combo that lasts seven seconds; to 
                    maintain it, the player must defeat more enemies and 
                    collect items.[6] Certain levels feature power-ups that 
                    alter Peppino's abilities, such as guns or knight armor,
                    [3][5] and Gustavo, an alternate player character who rides 
                    on the back of his giant pet rat.[7] Palette-swap outfits 
                    for Peppino can be acquired through completing challenges 
                    and obtaining achievements.[8] 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each level contains various secrets: pizza topping creatures 
                    that the player rescues to unlock boss fights;[1] a treasure 
                    locked behind a door that can only be opened by a janitor 
                    the player must find; and three hidden rooms that provide 
                    points.[3] At the end of most levels, the player finds a 
                    pillar they must destroy.[5] This activates "Pizza Time", 
                    a phase in which the player must return to the level's 
                    entrance within a time limit to avoid being caught by 
                    Pizzaface.[3][4][9] The player is forced to restart the 
                    level if they fail.[3] A portal allows the player to do an 
                    optional second lap in which they return to the end and must 
                    make their way back to the entrance again for bonus points.
                    [3] After completing each level, the player is given a 
                    letter grade based on their score and performance. The 
                    highest rank, P, can only be acquired if the player obtains 
                    enough points, finds the three secrets, collects the 
                    treasure, and completes a second lap while maintaining a 
                    single, uninterrupted combo.[10] 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Pizza Tower does not feature traditional difficulty levels; 
                    rather, the difficulty depends on what the player chooses 
                    to achieve.[5] Secrets are optional and there are no lives 
                    or health. Colliding with an obstacle does not hurt Peppino, 
                    though it lowers the player's score and subtracts two 
                    seconds from the combo timer.[1][6] The only stages where 
                    Peppino can be harmed are the boss fights, arena battles 
                    against foes such as the Vigilante, a cheese cowboy, and 
                    the Noise, Peppino's archenemy.[1][3] The player must dodge 
                    the bosses' attacks and deplete their health to proceed.[11] 
                    A New Game Plus mode featuring the Noise as a playable 
                    character was added in a free update on March 12, 2024.[12]
                    [13] The Noise controls similarly to Peppino,[12] but has a 
                    slightly different moveset revolving around his skateboard 
                    and jet pack.[14] Playing as the Noise also alters the user 
                    interface elements and music.[12]

                <p>
                    Pizza Tower was the debut project of the indie developer 
                    Tour De Pizza, which developed it for around five years.
                    [15] Development was led by the pseudonymous designer and 
                    artist McPig,[16] also known as Pizza Tower Guy,[17] and 
                    funded through Patreon.[18] The concept originated from the 
                    Peppino character, who McPig created for comics and drawings 
                    in which he imagined pizza monsters appearing in his 
                    restaurant at night. McPig conceived a role-playing video 
                    game (RPG) with survival horror elements similar to Resident 
                    Evil in which Peppino traversed his restaurant while 
                    battling pizza monsters. It featured a cartoonish but dark 
                    style that McPig compared to Courage the Cowardly Dog.[17]  
                </p>
                <p>
                    McPig attempted to develop the game using RPG Maker, but 
                    the game engine's limitations prevented him from achieving 
                    the animation quality he desired.[17] McPig switched to 
                    GameMaker since it was accessible and he had seen other 
                    developers use it for smaller projects. He began developing 
                    Weenie Cop, a platform game featuring a sentient hot dog who 
                    battled junk food criminals. Though he described this 
                    project as "all over the place in the gameplay department 
                    because it wasn't very well conceptualized", it got him 
                    accustomed to GameMaker.[17] He also conceived a game in 
                    which Peppino attacked using a pizza cutter chainsaw, 
                    inspired by Wario's dash from the Wario Land series.[17]       
                </p>
                <p>
                    Wanting to work from a point of reference, McPig switched 
                    to a Wario Land-inspired platformer. The series had been 
                    dormant since Wario Land: Shake It! (2008) and McPig felt 
                    it needed a spiritual successor in the vein of games like 
                    A Hat in Time (2017), Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night 
                    (2019), and Wargroove (2019) to show its publisher, 
                    Nintendo, that fans were still interested.[17] He decided 
                    to use Peppino as the protagonist—thinking he "was just fun 
                    to draw and relatable enough in his character traits"—and 
                    retained the basic concept of "a scared crazy pizza man 
                    fighting pizza monsters" from the RPG.[17] The title, Pizza 
                    Tower, came from the Leaning Tower of Pisa, as the "Pisa" 
                    reminded McPig of "pizza".[17] Development began around 
                    2018, and the pseudonymous Sertif joined as the programmer 
                    in early 2020.[18]

                    McPig initially designed Pizza Tower as a maze-like, 
                    puzzle-oriented platform game similar to Wario Land.[18] 
                    To prepare, he played every Wario Land game and dropped 
                    Peppino's chainsaw to make the gameplay more similar. The 
                    Game Boy Advance entry Wario Land 4 (2001) was the biggest 
                    inspiration, with McPig likening Pizza Tower's level design 
                    to Wario Land 4's with a greater emphasis on dashing. He 
                    modeled the level progression on Wario Land 4's "frog 
                    switch" game mechanic and use of power-up-based puzzles.
                    [17] Power-ups were originally designed in the style of 
                    Wario Land, opening new areas while slowing the player down. 
                    In 2021, the game underwent a change in direction and became 
                    more speed-oriented. The levels were streamlined and McPig 
                    and Sertif changed how they handled power-ups so they would 
                    fit the speed without feeling like a burden.[18] 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Peppino's basic moveset was based on Wario's from Wario Land 
                    4. It evolved as McPig and Sertif observed how players 
                    played a 2019 demo that experimented "with a more free-form 
                    moveset" and decided to emphasize speed and score-attack 
                    elements.[18] They linked Peppino's different abilities, 
                    which Sertif described as "an absolute nightmare when doing 
                    level design" since it complicated the game balance.[18] 
                    McPig and Sertif experimented with limitations, but found 
                    them unfun and chose to go with the freer moveset. Early 
                    versions included a traditional health system, but McPig and 
                    Sertif removed it to make the gameplay more accessible; the 
                    ranking system was included to reward skilled players.[18] 
                    McPig and Sertif introduced the secondary playable 
                    character, Gustavo, to streamline a pizza delivery-based 
                    level as they reduced the maze-like design.[18] They also 
                    experimented with playable versions of the Vigilante and 
                    Noise, though neither was playable at launch. Whereas 
                    Gustavo was a distinct character with dedicated segments, 
                    the Vigilante and Noise were playable in Peppino's levels 
                    and thus closer to him in feel. PC Gamer theorized that the 
                    number of power-ups changing Peppino's moveset made the 
                    addition of multiple characters with unique sprites 
                    unfeasible.[12] 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each level began as a basic theme, such as a city or space. 
                    McPig and Sertif conceived around 28 levels; they cut and 
                    combined themes to make development feasible. They wanted 
                    each level to feel distinct and accessible to both skilled 
                    and unskilled players. Sertif said that after conceiving a 
                    game mechanic, generally, he would begin prototyping while 
                    McPig created animations in Aseprite. Sertif described this 
                    process as challenging since it meant many ideas ended up 
                    scrapped, but felt it was for the best since they both 
                    worked quickly: "we implemented a lot of things we wouldn't 
                    have otherwise, scrapping the bad ideas, leaving only the 
                    decent or good ones."[18] Sertif estimated that every level 
                    was redesigned two or three times between 2020 and 2023.[18] 
                    Members of McPig's Discord server provided feedback 
                    throughout the development.[17][18]
                </p>
                <p>
                    SpongeBob SquarePants and the French comics McPig had grown 
                    up reading inspired Pizza Tower's pixel art style.[17] McPig 
                    chose a cartoon style because it was the only one he felt 
                    confident using. Additionally, he felt low-resolution pixel 
                    art evocative of the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) and 
                    Super NES era was too common in the indie game scene, and 
                    that Pizza Tower's style and higher resolution art would 
                    make it stand out.[17] Sertif described Peppino as "an 
                    absolute mess, and we (or rather McPig) wanted to convey 
                    that in every animation."[18] McPig colored Peppino like 
                    Wario's sprite from Wario Land 3 (2000) and his pants black 
                    to make animating them easier.[17] He based the Noise on the 
                    Noid, an advertising mascot used by the pizza chain 
                    Domino's, feeling he would be a suitable villain for a 
                    pizza-based game. McPig did not put much thought into the 
                    character and enemy designs, preferring to "make it up as 
                    [he went] along".[17]

                    The soundtrack was composed by Ronan "Mr. Sauceman" de 
                    Castel and the pseudonymous ClascyJitto.[16] It was de 
                    Castel's first published work; composition was mostly a 
                    hobby for him and he never released any of his music out of 
                    insecurity. He learned about Pizza Tower around the time he 
                    was beginning to take composing seriously and was mesmerized 
                    by the gameplay videos he saw on Twitter.[16] He wrote a 
                    demo track and emailed it to McPig. To de Castel's surprise, 
                    McPig loved the track and asked him to join the project.[16] 
                    The track, which McPig felt "sounded perfectly insane and 
                    dynamic",[17] became "It's Pizza Time!", the escape theme.
                    [16] McPig recruited ClascyJitto, a high school student who 
                    published music on SoundCloud and Bandcamp in their spare 
                    time, after they shared remixes of de Castel's work in the 
                    Discord server.[19]

                    De Castel and ClascyJitto, who worked in France and the 
                    United States, respectively, each composed about half the 
                    soundtrack,[19] while the pseudonymous Post Elvis composed 
                    the title screen theme.[16] De Castel's video game 
                    inspirations included Sonic CD (1993) and the Wario Land 
                    series, specifically Wario Land 4. He also looked to the 
                    electronic, funk, and house music of artists such as Chick 
                    Corea, Daft Punk, Mr. Oizo, and Justice.[16] ClascyJitto, 
                    whose prior work relied heavily on sampling and remixes, 
                    described working on Pizza Tower as "sort of like a fun 
                    little game for me" since it required them to put more time 
                    into each composition.[19]

                    McPig started promoting Pizza Tower in 2018 by sharing 
                    screenshots on Tumblr, before moving to Twitter to raise its 
                    profile. He also started the Discord server to get feedback.
                    [18] McPig released two game demos in 2018, and opened a 
                    Patreon where he offered early access builds for those who 
                    pledged $5 monthly.[18] After Sertif joined, McPig began 
                    streaming development on Twitch and releasing builds yearly 
                    rather than monthly.[18]

                    Pizza Tower was released for Windows via Steam on January 
                    26, 2023.[20] Tour De Pizza stated that post-release 
                    development was underway in September.[21] A 
                    Halloween-themed update, released on October 23, added a 
                    secret level, collectible pumpkins, and Steam Community 
                    features.[22] McPig has stated he will not consider releases 
                    for other platforms until finishing the Windows version.[17] 
                    An update adding the Noise as a playable character was 
                    released on March 12, 2024.[12]

                    Pizza Tower has developed a large fandom, which Sertif 
                    attributed to the demos, Patreon builds, and livestreamers 
                    such as Vinesauce showcasing it.[18] Following the release, 
                    Tour De Pizza collaborated with Fangamer to produce 
                    merchandise including plushies, T-shirts, and pins,[23] and 
                    the Discord server's membership grew from 5,000 to 20,000 
                    before McPig and Sertif discontinued it.[18] The game's 
                    Steam player count spiked to over 9,000 playing at once 
                    following the release of the Noise update.[24]
